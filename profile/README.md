A camping-vibes, dark-blue, dark yellow color palette.<br>
Created to keep your workspace clean and minimal, with well-designed contrasted colors, and a convenient palette...<br>
Consisting of three dark soft blue colors followed by three contrary light colors, and a dark yellow accent color with brightness variation, finished with a frill coloring to the palette to give it the shine...<br>
Picking these colors was accompanied by care for the color-coding potential, the convenience of coordination, and the eye-comfortability...
